			<h1>Introduction: How to Use the New York Times Books API</h1>
			<h3 id="author">by Yoav Gil</h3>
			<h2>About the Books API</h2>
			<p>The New York Times has an extensive amount of best seller lists and book reviews. They provide a free, public API to access this data. You can use this API to search through various best seller lists, or to look up review information for a particular book.</p>
			<p>The following are important sources of information:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Information about <a href="http://developer.nytimes.com/docs/books_api/">the NYT Books API</a>
				<li>Information about <a href="http://developer.nytimes.com/">NYT APIs in general</a>
				<li>A list of <a href="http://developer.nytimes.com/docs">all NYT APIs</a>
			</ul>
			<h2>Getting Started</h2>
			<p>The first thing you want to do is <a href="http://developer.nytimes.com/apps/register">register for an API key</a>. You will need to create a free account first; once you are logged in, just return to this link. There, you can request keys for as many NYT APIs as you would like. On the NYT website, you'll see something that looks like the following to request a Books API key:</p>

			<p>After you successfully create a key, you should see something like the following for each key you requested (with all the fields populated):</p>

			<p>Note that the NYT uses different API keys for each of their many APIs, so make sure you are using the correct key when you send a request. If you use the wrong key, your request will not work.</p>
			<h2>Important Notes:</h2>
			<p>For the examples in this guide, I am using <a href="https://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a> with the <a href="http://expressjs.com/">Express</a> module. You should be familiar with JavaScript to follow along with my examples. I am also using the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/request">request module</a> to send API requests. Unless you're sending your HTTP requests using another method, you must install this module, and then include it with the following line:</p>
			<pre>var request = require('request');</pre>
			<p>Also, I have saved my NYT Books API key as a string called <code>nytBooksKey</code> in a file called <code>credentials.js</code>. I therefore access my key using <code>credentials.nytBooksKey</code>. If you define your key in the same file that you perform your API calls, you do not need to access it using <code>credentials.nytBooksKey</code>; you can access it using whatever variable you defined.</p>
			<p>In my examples, I print the body of the HTTP responses to the console. In reality, I rendered these responses in an HTML page and viewed them in a web browser, to make them easier to display and read (using the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-handlebars">Express-Handlebars module</a>). When you see a <code>console.log</code> line, this is usually the end of my example, and you can either display the data however you see fit, or manipulate it further to parse out the relevant information.</p>
